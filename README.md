# Capstone-Final-Project--College-Student-Outcomes
College Students Enrollment Outcomes


There are many determining factors that play a role in a student getting in to college, attending college, graduating, and dropping out. My goal is to highlight all these factors so that admissions 
have an easier time picking the right students and advocating for students who may not be getting the support they need to complete their degree.

For Capstone Final Project - Target_Graduate, I performed a classification model with the x variables as mother’s occupation and age at enrollment and the y variable as whether or not they graduated.

For Capstone Final Project Target Dropout , I performed another classification model with the x variables as mother’s occupation and special needs and the y variables as whether or not the students dropped out. 

For Capstone Final Project Target_Enrolled, I performed yet another classification model with the x variables as mother’s occupation and mother’s qualification and the y variables as whether or not the student enrolled.

In the Visualizations for Final Project Completed I made several visualizations mainly bar graphs representing student’s outcomes of applying and attending college. 

The recommendations I made for this project were for high school guidance counselors, admission counselors, and health care providers for them to provide students the necessary care and attention they need so they can become successful in their educational career.
